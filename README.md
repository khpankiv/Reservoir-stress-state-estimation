# Reservoir-stress-state-estimation
This program estimates the stress and starined state of the wall of the oil cilindrical vertical tank.

This program was a part of my [PhD research](../Autoref.pdf).
Using it it's possible to estimate the stress and strained state of the wall of the vertical cilindrical steel oil tank by it's displasements.

Matlab was used to create this program.
It has GUI, developed in Matlab too.
